If this is your first time working with github actions, then use the below example.
If you have already worked on it, go for 2nd code snippet

```yaml
jobs:
  lighthouse-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Compare lighthouse data
        uses: mdsadiq/lighthouse-compare@v1.2.0
        with:
          lhciServerURL: https://example.com
          githubToken: ${{ secret.LH_COMPARE_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN }}
```

```yaml
    uses: mdsadiq/lighthouse-compare@v1.2.0
